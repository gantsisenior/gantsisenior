		<h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>

		<h3 class="about-hyperlinks" id="h-1">1. Names and Opening</h3>
		<p>The official name of the school is Ghanzi Senior Secondary School. It was opened in 1994 and had to initially 
		   operate from Ledumang Senior Secondary School in Gaborone because construction at its permanent in Ghanzi had 
		   just begun. The school moved to Ghanzi at the beginning of 1995 when some buildings had been completed.</p>
		
		<h3 class="about-hyperlinks" id="h-2">2. How To Get Here</h3>

		   Mamuno-Ghanzi(199km). We are happy to inform you that all these roads are completely tarred. There is currently
		   adequate public transport between Ghanzi and other major centres, particularly between Gaborone and Ghanzi with 
		   three modern buses that go either way every day of the week. There is also public transport (combi/taxi) to school

		   year which can be paid in term instalments of P2000. Term instalments must be paid within the first 10 days of
		   the term. Non-payment will lead to the student being sent home to collect the fees. If the student is boarding, 
		   they will pay an additional P700 per year which, like school fees, can be paid as per term.</p>
		   
		<h4 class="underline" >CITIZEN STUDENTS</h4>
