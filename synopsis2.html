				    also use appropriate available resources to solve problems in a community or society.</p>
				<p>The commonly used materials are wood, metal, electronic components, plastics, pneumatics, and 
				   computer graphics. Sometimes, others like concrete, reed, fabrics, clay, card boxes, Plaster of 
				   Paris, leather, bamboo and so on. Students with good JC grades and experience in Design and Technology
				   are preferred.</p>
				<p>Career Opportunities: <br/>Self-employment, Engineering, Architecture, Draught, Teaching etc.</p>
				
				<h2>ART AND DESIGN</h2>
				<p>In defining Art and Design, many philosophers attempted and gave different definitions such as:</p>
				<ol><li>It is a visual language of communicating our feelings and emotions.</li>
					<li>An aesthetic object where aesthetic means beauty.</li>
					<li>A historical record</li>
					<li>It is everything (around us)</li>
					<li>It is a personal thing</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The department areas are substantial with five studios or work - rooms and an exhibition room. At the
				   moment, the most adequate areas are as follows: Drawing and Painting, Fabric Printing and Decoration,
				   Sculpture, Pottery/Ceramics, Graphics and Environmental Design.</p>
				<p>Career Opportunities and Openings<br/>Fine Artist, Art Impressionist, Cartoonist, Potter, Advertising 
					and Landscaping and Interior Design.</p>
				
				<h2>GEOGRAPHY</h2>
				<p>This is an important earth science subject. It generally enables learners to study the physical and human 
					environments and hence being multi-disciplinary in nature as it deals with the descriptions and 
					explanations of land, sea, atmospheric processes, fauna, flora and interactions between human beings 
					and their environment. It thus develops in the learner sensitivity to environmental issues.</p>
				<p>With the volume of knowledge you would have accrued at the end of the course, job prospects are many in the 
					fields of engineering, geology, meteorology, biology, planning, economics, linguistics, history,
					anthropology, sociology, mathematics and computer sciences. Specific areas of professional 
					employment are in the fields of climatology, penology, biogeography, geomorphology, natural resources,
					environmental studies, photogrammetry remote sensing, cartography, town planning, economic geography,
					political geography, surveying, teaching, pilot, statistician forester etc.</p>				
				
				<h2>HISTORY</h2>
				<p>This is a social science subject focusing on the past, present and future of societies and nations in 
					general. It impacts skills of creative thinking; writing and research. Relate career opportunities

				<h2>MATHEMATICS</h2>
				<p>Mathematics Department offers the following subjects:</p>
				<ul><li><li>Core Mathematics and Extension Mathematics</li>
						<li>Statistics</li>
						<li>Additional Mathematics</li>
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Mathematics Core Subject<br/>Core mathematics is a compulsory subject in senior secondary schools. High
					ability students choose to write the an extra paper, called Extension Mathematics.<br/>All 
					students are loaned mathematics textbooks, mathematical instruments and a scientific calculator only
					once during their two years stay in the institution. Students must take care of the items issued to them 
					and use them to prepare for examinations. If any of the items is damaged or lost by the student, the
					parent/guardian is expected to buy/purchase the same brand of the lost item immediately, which will enable
					the student to continue his/her study effectively in the classroom and examination. Any delay in purchasing
					the lost item may result in lowering the performance of the child in mathematics.</p>
				<p>A good grade in mathematics is required for further education, not just Degree in Mathematics but other
					subjects like Sciences, Engineering, Agriculture, Accounting, Home Economics etc. Knowledge of statistics
					is very useful in understanding other subjects at senior secondary level. Other applications include
					population studies,research, business studies etc. If a students wants to be a pilot, Engineer, Mathematician,
					Additional Mathematics is the subject to choose. Our career teachers can give more information about the 
					career opportunities in mathematics.</p>
				
				<h2>DEVELOPMENT STUDIES (DVS)</h2>
				<p>This is an interdisciplinary subject, which focuses on the interaction of the economic, social and political

					also equips them with skills and knowledge to initiate, organize and control production enterprises when 
					they leave school. Development Studies further addresses the concerns of bringing about sustainable 
					development and utilization of resources and hence reflects the linking of theory and practice promoting
